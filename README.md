# Georgetown Travelers

This webpage was created in coordination with the offices of Risk Management, Global Education, and University Information Services to map where members within the Georgetown University community frequently travel as well as health and safety risks within those countries. It uses the standard Boostrap and CSS files for styling per the Whitehaven Drupal template and also the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) Javascript library to create the Map and it's multiple layers.

Data for Travelers and Study Abroad numbers were obtained from the Georgetown Travel Office and the Office of Global Education, respectively. Data on the World Risk Index and Zika were obtained from the [World Risk Report](http://weltrisikobericht.de/english/>) and the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/active-countries.html).
